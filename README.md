---

## Features

- Upload and validate image files (`jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`) for videos.
- Automatically saves images to BunnyCDN via HTTP PUT.
- Updates the video record in the database with the image path.
- Generates CDN URLs for accessing uploaded images.
- Supports custom folder paths and bright background handling.

---

## Requirements

- Laravel (assumes usage of Input, Response, Eloquent, and Config)
- Guzzle HTTP Client (`guzzlehttp/guzzle`)
- BunnyCDN storage configuration

---

- Calls BunnyCDN upload method
- Saves the image URL to the corresponding video record

**Arguments:**
- `$file`: Uploaded file
- `$video_id`: Video ID
- `$img_file_name`: String used as a part of the filename
- `$store_path`: (optional) BunnyCDN folder path
- `$db_field`: Name of the database field to update

---

### `uploadFile($file_path_name, $filename, $path)`

Uploads the file to BunnyCDN using a `PUT` request.

**Arguments:**
- `$file_path_name`: Local path to the file
- `$filename`: Name to save the file as on BunnyCDN
- `$path`: Subfolder in BunnyCDN

**Returns:**

# ProxyServerController

This PHP controller facilitates communication between a client (e.g., Roku application) and two advertising services: **Amazon Publisher Services (APS)** and **SpringServe**. It acts as a proxy server that builds requests dynamically based on incoming parameters and returns VAST XML ads or debugging info.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Dynamically builds ad request payloads for APS.
- Forwards request results to either APS or SpringServe.
- Provides logging for all requests/responses.
- Includes support for debug mode and fallback error handling.
- Designed to work with a Roku-based ad-supported app ecosystem.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- Laravel Framework (indirectly inferred via `Request` and `BaseController`)
- `curl` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle`
- Logging directory: `/var/log/laravel/proxy.log`

## ðŸ§© Methods Overview

### `aps_server_request_sending(string $payload = '', bool $amzn_debug_mode = false): string`
Sends an ad request to APS using raw `curl`. Used internally.

### `aps_server_request_sending_request(...)`
Main entry method that:
- Parses incoming GET params (e.g. `ua`, `os`, `content_type`)
- Constructs the request payload
- Calls APS and processes the response
- Forwards the response to either:
  - APS VAST endpoint (`send_key_values_to_aps`)
  - SpringServe endpoint (`send_key_values_to_spring_server`)

### `get_channel_spring_server_and_id(int $channel_id): string`
Returns SpringServe ID based on the Roku channel ID.
